*Question 1*

Three applications that use a database system that I use in my daily life are Amazon, Chase Bank, and E-Learning. Amazon stores information about products, prices, and sellers. This can be accessed through query or using keywords. For instance, the other day I purchased a lamp with three shelves. I asked for "lamp" with "shelf" in the search bar. Chase Bank stores information about customers financial histories, credit scores, account numbers and so on. E-Learning is a learning management system that stores information about courses, instructors, and students.

*Question 2*

One application I can propose in Economics is a personal budget dashboard. Each consumer can look at their history of spending and see the categories of items they have spent on. This will give not only policymakers but also market researchers insight into what consumers spend on, at different economic times. Such as when there is a boom or a recession.

With the help of ChatGPT, this is what the interface would look like: The consumer view of the Personal Budget Dashboard features a user-friendly header with navigation options for the Dashboard, Budget Goals, and Trends. The main section includes a Spending Overview Widget that compares the current month's total expenses against the budget, helping users track their financial health at a glance. An interactive pie chart provides a detailed breakdown of spending categories, while a line graph illustrates monthly spending trends over time for better insight into patterns. At the footer, users can easily add new expenses or export their financial reports. For researchers and policymakers, the dashboard offers widgets that display a consumer spending heatmap by region, a spending shift comparison between economic booms and recessions, and insights into top spending categories, providing valuable information for economic analysis and decision-making.

*Question 4*

As we have discussed in class, NoSQL systems emerged in the 2000s primarily due to the rise of big data, social media platforms, and cloud-based applications. Traditional relational databases (RDBMS) struggled to handle the scalability, speed, and flexibility demands of massive and diverse data. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook required storage solutions that could efficiently manage high-volume, unstructured, and semi-structured data.


*Question 6*

Three tables that might be used to store data on a social media platform, as we discussed in class, includes UserID's, data of likes and comments or relationships with followers, as well as posts.
